# fun-coursework

In the past, I've had the pleasure to work on open-ended, creative assignments in Computer Science classes I have taken. Here are two prior projects I'm happy with!

## cake-weighter

Add the weights of cakes (of 3 types) and see the data visualized (using `tkinter`)! It was cool trying to figure out the graphics of charts more manually, instead of relying on plotting libraries.

## pandemic-simulator

Tkinter-based app that "simulates" a pandemic! The user can customize inputs such as infectivity and population size, which affect the SIR model that is used behind the scenes. This is _not_ medically accurate and not intended to represent the outcomes of any real virus! (Though the settings was inspired by a certain 21st-century pandemic...) It was fun to learn about the math behind infection models!
